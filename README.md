# Snake Project for my C++ laboratory

The project was made with CLion IDE.

- In this task, we have to create our own replica of Snake using the C++ SFML library.
- The Snake is represented by a list from the STL library.
- There is a scoreboard that saves to a file and a menu with different difficulty levels.
